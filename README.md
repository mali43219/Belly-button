# Belly-button Challenge

Roza is working on a dashboard and needs to finish visualizing bacterial data for each volunteer. The goal is to help volunteers identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This information will be useful for identifying whether a bacterial species found in their navel is a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, which is something that a company called Improbable Beef is interested in.
